## Sanjana Waghray — Bridging Data Science, Finance & AI with Statistical Depth

## About
Where data meets design, logic meets empathy, and AI learns to explain itself. I craft intelligent systems that transform raw, unstructured data into clear, actionable insight — from real-time churn prediction to generative finance engines that reason and adapt.
My fascination lies in how data moves the world — through markets, behavior, and intelligence itself.
At the intersection of data science, finance, and AI engineering, I build systems that don’t just analyze information — they act on it.

## What I’m Passionate About
	•	Real-time analytics and financial forecasting
	•	Explainable AI and model transparency (SHAP, LIME)
	•	Agentic AI systems that can analyze, plan, and automate workflows
	•	Building end-to-end pipelines that scale from prototype to production

## Featured Projects

	1. Brain Tumor Detection (CNN)	Trained and evaluated ResNet18 on MRI data; achieved 92% accuracy with visualization dashboard for interpretability.
	2. TAVI: Multimodal AI Assistant	Built an assistive agent using BLIP + OCR + LLM for visually impaired users — achieved 92% precision and <200 ms response time.
	3. Financial Forecasting (ARIMA/SARIMA)	 Developed forecasting models for BSE-30 stock prices, integrating a crossover trading strategy to identify optimal buy–sell patterns. Applied Box-Cox transformations, seasonal differencing, and comprehensive diagnostics to ensure robust trend and volatility analysis.
	4. Expense Tracker + Optimizer (Streamlit)	SQL-powered personal finance dashboard that tracks spending, goals, and suggests budget optimizations in real time.
	5. Real-Time Customer Churn Engine	Kafka-based streaming pipeline → Snowflake warehouse → XGBoost + SHAP for model explainability → Airflow DAGs for automation and alerts. Deployed to monitor 1.1M+ loyalty members.
	

## Tech Stack

	- Languages → Python, SQL, R
	- Libraries → scikit-learn, XGBoost, PyTorch, LangChain, SHAP
	- Data Engineering → Snowflake, Kafka, Airflow, Spark (basics)

## 🏆 Highlights

	•	🧩 Built an explainable churn pipeline used to guide real marketing strategies.
	•	💹 Developed stock price forecasting models with strong predictive performance.
	•	🏅 “Data Detective” award @ Camping World for analytics excellence.
	•	🥉 3rd Place @ IEEE RTC 2025 conference and Hack for Accessibility Hackathon (Google sponsored) for TAVI project.
	•	🎓 Research Assistant: Bayesian Optimization & Quasi-Monte Carlo methods (QMCPy).


## Beyond Code 🌍

I believe data science is most powerful when it tells human stories — of markets, people, and systems — and turns those stories into action. Whether it’s forecasting revenue, uncovering churn drivers, or designing explainable AI, I strive to make data intuitive, inclusive, and impactful.
